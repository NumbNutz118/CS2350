  <p>One of the big things I do outside of work or school, is play games. Most of the time with friends, which is why I find so much joy in playing them. Sometimes they get me hyped, and other times, they calm me down. It's usually just about the mood I'm in and what game I want to play at the time.</p>

</a>
  <p>Another big thing I do outside of work and school, and if I'm not playing video games, is watching movies. Movies are the best thing to relax to, or sleep to. I always fall asleep to movies. Not because they're boring, but because they're not. The action is what allows my mind to sleep.</p>
