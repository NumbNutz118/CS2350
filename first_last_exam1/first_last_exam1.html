                    <p>This Giant Noah’s Ark Replica Is Stranded In The UK Because British Authorities Don’t Believe
                        It’s Seaworthy. The floating museum can't actually sail on its own and has to be towed wherever
                        it goes. It has been trapped by an international stalemate over its status as a "non-certified
                        floating vessel."</p>

                    <p>New Pokemon Oreos are giving fans something to get excited about — and providing collectors with
                        a new avenue to potentially rake in thousands of dollars.
                        Launched earlier this month, the new Oreo x Pokemon collaboration features the brand's
                        traditional sandwich cookies, this time emblazoned with one of 16 Pokemon.</p>

                    <p>In the latest example of a wicked hot housing market, a 10-foot wide house in Boston has sold for $1.25 million.
                        Located in the city's historic North End neighborhood, the 2-bedroom 1-bath home was built in 1890, according to city tax records, though some accounts say 1862.</p>
